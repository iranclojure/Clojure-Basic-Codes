<h1>REPL example</h1>
<h3>REPL stands for  READ - EVAL - PRINT - LOOP  </h3>
<h4>REPL in clojure is like a shell so you can test any code in it before you put that in your project.</h4>
<h4>You can open repl with "lein repl" command , execute it in your project root directory.</h4>
<h4>Test these commands in your repl :<h4>
    <h4>==> (println "HelloWorld")</h4>
    <h4>==> (= 1 1)</h4>
<h4>You can do almost anything in clojure repl !!</h4>
